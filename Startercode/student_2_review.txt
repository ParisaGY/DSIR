positive:
Clean and easy to follow, comment are understandable. Everything works well. Thanks!

negative: You import a library (numpy) that you did not use it

suggestion:
define which python version you are using. Some libraries are not working in python 2.7
I suggest using spyder to do programming in the Python language because on the left bar it shows orange triangle
and give you some information of the error or waring incase you have any.
