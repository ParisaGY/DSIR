positive:
Clean and easy to follow.
Comment are understandable.


negative:
You imported some library that you did not use them such as numpy and train_test_split
Line 20 the name of variable is different from the name of variable used in line 16.
if you want to use cross validation techniques you need to choose cv > 1. CV=1 does not help.

suggestion:
Define which python version you are using. some libraries are not working in python 2.7
I suggest using spyder to do programming in the Python language because on the left bar it shows orange triangle
and give you some information of the error or waring incase you have any.
It is better to import all the library you want to use on top
